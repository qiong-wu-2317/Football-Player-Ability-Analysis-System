# **Design Patterns in FootballPlayerAbilityAnalysis**

This document explains the application of three design patterns in the Football Player Ability Analysis System: **Factory, Strategy, and Observer**. 
---

## **Factory Pattern - ComparisonReportFactory.js (hypothetical)**

### **Implementation**
```js
export class ReportFactory {
    static generateReport(type, player1, player2, metrics) {
        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "comparison":
                return new ComparisonReport(player1, player2, metrics);
            default:
                throw new Error(`Unsupported report type: ${type}`);
        }
    }
}
```

### **OOP application**
- **Encapsulation**: Users do not interact with individual class constructors.
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new types of reports (e.g., tactical report).
- **Simplifies object creation**: Abstracts report instantiation.

### **Anti-Pattern (Violation)**
```js
let report;
if (type === 'comparison') {
    report = new ComparisonReport(...);
}
```
- Hardcoded logic, not extensible, breaks OCP.

## **Strategy Pattern - EvaluationModel.js**

### **Implementation**
```js
export class EvaluationModel {
    constructor(weightings) {
        this.weightings = weightings;
    }

    score(player) {
        const weights = this.weightings[player.role];
        let score = 0;
        for (const attrType of ['technical', 'physical', 'mental']) {
            for (const key in player[attrType]) {
                score += player[attrType][key] * (weights[attrType][key] || 0);
            }
        }
        return score;
    }

    classify(player) {
        return 'Midfielder'; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```

### **OOP application**
- **Encapsulation**: All scoring logic is encapsulated.
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom weighting strategies.
- **Reusability**: Can support multiple evaluation schemes for different clubs.

## **Observer Pattern - RecommendationSystem.js (hypothetical)**

### **Implementation**
```js
export class Observer {
    receiveUpdate(data) {
        throw new Error("Method not implemented");
    }
}

export class Manager extends User {
    receiveUpdate(playerList) {
        console.log("Recommended players updated:", playerList);
    }
}
```

### **OOP application**
- **Loose coupling**: Recommendations system notifies subscribed users.
- **Scalability**: Add more observers without modifying core logic.

# OOP Pillars in FootballPlayerAbilityAnalysis

## Abstraction

### Good Example:
```js
class Player {
    evaluate(model) {
        this.score = model.score(this);
    }
}
```
**Why it works**: `evaluate()` hides scoring detail.

---

## Encapsulation

### Good Example:
```js
class Player {
    #technical;
    getTechnical() {
        return this.#technical;
    }
}
```
**Why it works**: Direct attribute access is protected.

---

## Inheritance

### Good Example:
```js
class Scout extends User {
    constructor(...) {
        super(...);
    }
}
```
**Why it works**: Shared functionality across user types.

---

## Polymorphism

### Good Example:
```js
const report = ReportFactory.generateReport("comparison", player1, player2, metrics);
```
**Why it works**: Different report types from same interface.

---

# SOLID Principles in FootballPlayerAbilityAnalysis

## SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

### Good Example:
```js
class PlayerReport {
    validate() {...}
    parse() {...}
}
```
**Why it works**: Handles only import/validation.

---

## OCP - Open-Closed Principle

### Good Example:
```js
class RoleClassifier {
    classify(player) {
        // strategy can change without modifying method
    }
}
```
**Why it works**: Supports new classification rules.

---

## LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle

### Good Example:
```js
const users = [new Scout(...), new Manager(...)];
users.forEach(user => user.notify());
```
**Why it works**: All user types behave similarly in interface.

---

## ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

### Good Example:
```js
class Scout extends User {
    importData()
    classifyPlayer()
}
```
**Why it works**: Methods relevant only to scout role.

---

## DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

### Good Example:
```js
class ReportService {
    constructor(reportModel) {
        this.reportModel = reportModel;
    }
}
```
**Why it works**: High-level module depends on abstraction.

By following OOP and SOLID principles, FootballPlayerAbilityAnalysis achieves high modularity, flexibility, and ease of testing and extension.
